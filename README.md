# Axway API-Manager Report tool

Use this tool to generate reports for your Axway API-Management V7.x platform. You can create reports such as:

![API Subscription report][1]

This report gives you details insights about the actual API-Subscription and can be further processed into other tools.

Under the hood it is using Swagger-Promote-Core as a library for the API-Manager communication, that retrieves the required Data-Model, which is then easily converted into a report of choice. That way, many different reports can be generated. If you need a special report not yet part of the package, just create an [issue][2].

With that you can export many different information from your API-Manager into different reports. Actually the following reports are available:

|Reportname|Type|Call it with ID|Description|
|:---------|-----|---------------|-----------|
|Embedded Analytics Metadata|CSV|CSVEmbeddedAnalyticsReport|Embedded Analytics is based on meta-data information from the API-Repository such as number of APIs, Application-Subscriptions, etc. Use this report to create a CSV and import it into EA.|
|Custom Policies|CSV|CSVCustomPolicyDependencyReport|This report tells you, which Policies are used by which API-Version. This is handy, if you would like to understand the impact when changing a policy. See a sample [here][3]|
|Custom Policies|Excel|ExcelCustomPolicyDependencyReport|See above|
|API Subscriptions|CSV|CSVAPISubscriptionReport|A reporting showing you which APIs + Version has been subscribed by which applications. See a sample [here][1]|
|API Subscriptions|Excel|ExcelAPISubscriptionReport|See above|

Call the script: `run-metadata-export.sh` delivered with the release, which generates the following usage:
```
usage: API-Manager Meta-Data Export -f <api-mgr-prod-metadata-export.csv> [-h <api-host>] [-p <changeme>] [-port <8181>] -r
       <CSVEmbeddedAnalyticsReport> [-u <apiadmin>]
 -f,--filename <api-mgr-prod-metadata-export.csv>   Filename used to export meta-data configuration (relative or absolute).
 -h,--host <api-host>                               The API-Manager hostname the API should be imported
 -p,--password <changeme>                           Password used to authenticate
 -port <8181>                                       Optional parameter to declare the API-Manager port. Defaults to 8075.
 -r,--report <CSVEmbeddedAnalyticsReport>           Type of report you want.
 -u,--username <apiadmin>                           Username used to authenticate. Please note, that this user must have Admin-Role

You may run one of the following examples:
scripts\run-metadata-export.bat -h localhost -u apiadmin -p changeme -f custom-policies -r ExcelCustomPolicyDependencyReport
